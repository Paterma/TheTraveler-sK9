      content="Welcome to my site, I'm Chloe Pfahl, and I created The Traveler's K9 in 2022 after working professionally with dogs (and other animals) for 6 years. I'm a balanced dog trainer who focuses on all quadrants of operant conditioning. You may be wondering where Traveler's come's from- I run a mobile business that allows me to be in remote locations; having a broad array of clients. My passion's include dog sports, thru hikes, and of course traveling with my dog. My mission it to create a profound bond between human and dog, resulting in a well mannered environment. Training services include Crate training, Potty Training, Puppy Nipping, Socialization, Name Recognition, Intro to Loose Leash Walking, Sit, Down, Place, Heeling, Recall, Boundaries, Off-Leash Reliability, E-Collar training, and behavior. I work with puppies puppies and adult dogs for in-home lessons, public outings, board-and-trains, and group lessons."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
